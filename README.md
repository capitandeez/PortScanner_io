# **PortScanner_io: A Professional-Grade Port Scanning Tool**  

## **Overview**  
PortScanner_io is a lightweight, high-performance port scanning utility designed for network administrators, security professionals, and developers. Built with Python, it provides a flexible and extensible framework for conducting TCP/UDP port scans, service detection, and basic vulnerability assessments.  

Unlike bloated alternatives, PortScanner_io emphasizes **speed, accuracy, and ethical usage**, making it ideal for authorized penetration testing, network diagnostics, and cybersecurity education.

## **Key Features**  

### **1. Scanning Capabilities**  
- **TCP Connect Scans** – Reliable detection of open ports.  
- **SYN (Half-Open) Scans** – Stealthier scanning for advanced users (requires root privileges).  
- **UDP Port Scans** – Identify open UDP services with ICMP-based verification.  
- **Banner Grabbing** – Retrieve service banners (e.g., HTTP, SSH, FTP) for fingerprinting.  

### **2. Flexible Target Specification**  
- Single IP (`192.168.1.1`)  
- IP Ranges (`192.168.1.1-100`)  
- CIDR Notation (`192.168.1.0/24`)  
- Hostnames (`example.com`)  

### **3. Output Options**  
- **Human-readable CLI tables**  
- **JSON/CSV export** for automated processing  
- **Configurable verbosity levels** (`-v`, `-vv`)  

### **4. Deployment & Integration**  
- **Docker support** for containerized scanning  
- **Proxy & SOCKS5 integration** (Tor, HTTP proxies)  
- **Minimal dependencies** – Pure Python where possible

## **Safety & Legal Guidelines**  

PortScanner_io is designed for **authorized use only**. Unauthorized port scanning may violate:  
- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)** (United States)  
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** (European Union)  
- **Other national cybersecurity laws**  

### **Permissible Use Cases**  
✅ Scanning **your own** networks and servers.  
✅ Conducting **authorized** penetration tests (with written consent).  
✅ Educational purposes in **controlled lab environments**.  

### **Prohibited Actions**  
❌ Scanning **external networks** without explicit permission.  
❌ Targeting **government, financial, or critical infrastructure** systems.  
❌ Using the tool for **malicious purposes** (e.g., reconnaissance for exploits).  

### **Best Practices**  
1. **Limit scan rate** (`-t 20`) to avoid triggering intrusion detection systems (IDS).  
2. **Use SYN scans sparingly**—they may be flagged as suspicious.  
3. **Always log results** (`-oJ scan.json`) for compliance and documentation.

## **Quick Start**  

### **Installation**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PortScanner_io.git  
cd PortScanner_io  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

### **Basic Scan Examples**  
```bash
# Scan top 100 ports on localhost  
python portscanner.py 127.0.0.1 --top-ports 100  

# Full TCP scan with banner grabbing (output to JSON)  
python portscanner.py 192.168.1.1 --all-ports --banner -oJ results.json  

# UDP scan (slower, requires root)  
sudo python portscanner.py 10.0.0.5 -sU -p 53,123,161  
```

### **Docker Usage**  
```bash
docker build -t portscanner .  
docker run --rm portscanner example.com -p 80,443 --banner  
```

## **Roadmap**  
Planned future enhancements:  
- **OS fingerprinting** (TCP/IP stack analysis)  
- **Integration with vulnerability databases** (CVE lookup)  
- **Web-based dashboard** (Flask/React frontend)
